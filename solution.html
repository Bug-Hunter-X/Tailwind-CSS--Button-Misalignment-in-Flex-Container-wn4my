The solution involves removing or adjusting conflicting padding and margins within the button's styles.  Below is the corrected HTML:

```html
<div class="flex justify-center items-center">
  <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-1 px-3 rounded">
    Click Me
  </button>
</div>
```

In this example, we've reduced the `py-2 px-4` to `py-1 px-3` to remove the excessive padding causing the misalignment.  Inspect the browser's developer tools to properly determine what values to adjust for your specific use case.
